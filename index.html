						<span style="font-size: 40px;">W</span>hen we listen to the word "Yoga", naturally a picture of some people performing some Asans(<i>Tadasana,Vrikshasana</i>,etc.) or meditating comes into our mind, but have you faced this question, "What is the need of yoga.. and is it necessary to practice yoga for living ?". 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
					<p>
						Different people have different aspects for practising yoga, some wants to increase their age( by good health), some wants to relax or stabilize their minds, which is regularly being tortured by material miseries. In Ancient times, or even in some small villages in India, some practice yoga to gain miraculous potencies, and many more. Is yoga necessary ? Yoga is not necessary for living, but obviously important. So let's go there, from where this term arises. 
					</p>
					<p>
						According to <i>Vedic literature</i>, the term <i>Yoga</i> is derived from the Sanskrit root "Yuj", which means to join or unite. But, what do we mean by unite ? Union of one's consciousness with that of Universal Consciousness, the consciousness of the Supreme. In other words, a way of establishing our relationship with the Supreme. So a question may arise,"Then how can yoga unite us with the Supreme Consciousness ?". For that, we must move around different ages(called <i>Yugas</i> in Sanskrit) and first try to understand their way of practising yoga.

				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<p><span style="font-size: 40px;">W</span>e have seen that yoga is nothing but a process of establishing our relationship with Supreme. But how ? To answer this let's see the process followed by people or sages in different ages. And also review the Vedic literature.</p><br>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>Satya Yuga</h3>
					<p>"Yuga of Truth", also known as "Golden Age". This yug was governed by demigods, and was devoid of any crime, murder or theft. People's actions were closest to purest ideals and thus referred as "Golden Age".
					According to <i>Vedic Literature</i>(combination of <i>Vedas, Upnishads, Puranas</i>), one can attain the ultimate happiness or bliss, or in other words the Supreme Lord, only by <strong>continuously meditating</strong>(also called <i>Tapasya</i>) on the <strong>Lotus feet of the Supreme Personality</strong> and following strict rules for more than 60,000 years.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRkNl9zTiEPNvcsSmZci3tBj3BZDVpSGSB6jA&usqp=CAU" width="70%" height="70%" style="padding-left: 30px;">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p> At that time, the average age was 1,00,000 years ! So obviously, age was not a ploblem... But strict rules are to be followed like the place where we meditate must be absolutely free from any disturbance, leaving all the facilities behind, leaving friends, family and all our dear ones; Must control the senses and mind with regularizing diet and sleep. But that's not possible and even <strong>not practical</strong> in this age of "<strong><i>Kali</i></strong>" ! So, this cannot be practised. Like a medicine is given to a child might be sweet in taste, but actually the purpose of it is to cure him from disease. Similarly, practice of yoga help ones to control the mind, be healthy(physically as well as mentally), but it's not the actual purpose of practicing Yoga. Actual purpose is to establish our relationship with Lord.</p>
			<br>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>Treta Yuga</h3>
					<p>Also known as the "Age of Mankind". The knowledge of Universal magnetism allowed humans to understand the forces of nature and the true nature of the universe. Agriculture and mining came into existence along with norms and rules to keep society under control. According to <i>Vedic Literature</i>, in this age, one can attain the love for the Supreme only by performing <strong>Sacrifices</strong> and <strong>Yajna</strong>(<i>Yagya</i>).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<img src="https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2016/story/images/big/12429_Untitled-3.gif" width="70%" height="70%">
				</div>
			</div>
			These yajna were only to be performed by learned <i>Brahmanas</i>, who knows full <i>Vedic Literature</i> and were capable of igniting the fire just by reciting the <i>Mantras</i>. Can we find any brahman like this in this age ? Obviously not. So, this method is also <strong>not practical</strong>.<br><br>
		
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>Dwapar Yuga</h3>
					<p>All people in this yug were desirous of achievement of the spiritual dharma that was prescribed to each class, and were competitive by nature. They were always engaged in penance and charity. According to <i>Vedas</i>, in this age, one can only attain the ultimate goal of life by <strong>gorgeous worship of the Lord(<i>Vigraha seva</i>)</strong> in Temples. But we can see, people even now are engaged in worshiping the Lord in the temples.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<img src="https://soolaba.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/c07-deity-worship.jpg?w=340&h=452" width="70%" height="70%">
				</div>
			</div>
			So is it wrong ? Absolutely not. It is just because Dwapar yug has recently passed out, and hence it is practised even today( will be practised upto 10,000 years ). But building of temples requires a lot of money and men power, which is not present in the required quantity, as it was present in that age. So, even this is <strong>not practical</strong> for the people in this age.<br><br>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h3>Kali Yuga</h3>
					<p>In this age common attributes and consequences are spiritual bankruptcy, mindless hedonism, breakdown of all social structure, greed and materialism, unrestricted egotism, afflictions and maladies of mind and body. In this age, according to <i>Vedas</i>, one can attain the love for Lord just by <strong>chanting of Holy name of the <i>Lord Krishna</i></strong>. As he is the Absolute, there is no difference in his form, his name and his activities. Easiest and <strong>Practical</strong> way.</p>

				<b>harer nāma harer nāma<br>
				harer nāmaiva kevalam<br>
				kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva<br>
				nāsty eva gatir anyathā<br></b> (7.72, Chaitanya Charitamrit-Adi Leela)<br>
				'For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali, there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.'<br><br>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<p>The chanting of the holy name is the only means to cross the ocean of nescience. One cannot attain the ultimate goal just by meditating, by charity or by any yajna. It is only attained by chanting of the name of Lord( not only in <i>Vedas</i>, but also written in <i>Quran & Bible</i>). One does not have to subtract anything from his life, but just add the Holy name of the Lord. Just remembering Lord while doing our work or duty gives the same benefit as was recieved by many sages in Ancient times, by following strict rules.</p>

			This boon is given to the people in this age by <i>Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu</i>, who himself is Lord Krishna in the form of a devotee. He came with devotional bliss of <i>Shrimati Radharani</i>, fully absorbed in Lord Krishna to gave the holy name in the form of <i>Mahamantra - "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare"</i><br>
			Lord Krishna says in Geeta(6.46) - "The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna."
